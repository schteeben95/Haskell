-- | sum1 : Compute the sum of the elements of a list of Integer
-- Use a straightforward primtive recursion to compute the sum,
-- with one case dealing with empty lists, and the other with non-empty lists.
--
-- Examples:
-- >>> sum1 []
-- 0
-- >>> sum1 [1,2,3,4]
-- 10
-- >>> sum1 [-1,1]
-- 0
sum1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
sum1 [] = 0

-- | sum2 : Compute the sum of the elements of a list of Integer
-- This time, use three cases:
-- one case for the empty list, returning 0,
-- a second case for a list of at least one element, returning x,
-- and a third case for a list of at least two elements x and y, plus a tail zs,
-- returning the result of invoking sum2 recursively on the (one shorter) list
-- constructed with (x+y) as head and zs as tail.
--
-- prop> sum1 l == sum2 l
